## [Background]{.underline}

Hello, My name is Mutsa Nyamuranga. I am excited to see where this new year takes me. Essentially, my family is from Zimbabwe, but I was born here in Georgia. I went to the University of Georgia for my undergraduate degree in Biology to pursue a career in medicine. I decided to complete a Master of Public Health degree with a concentration in Epidemiology along the way.

## [Interests]{.underline}

Disease distribution and methods to mitigate infectious disease outbreaks are of interest. I would like to generate skills in biostatistics and data analysis so I felt that taking MADA would be prudent.

## [Experience]{.underline}

I do not have a comprehensive background in coding, but I have used R, SAS, and STATA programs for other course projects. However, I have taken Biostat 1 and 2.

## [Quirk]{.underline}

Not so sure I have a quirky fact and thing apart from being an intense Manchester United soccer fan.

## [Interesting Website]{.underline}

https://www.kdnuggets.com/

I found this website earlier and I thought was interesting because it provides the latest news and opinions on coding and AI. One article posted Jan. 9, 2024 describes how a lack of data governance can lead to fatigue in the use of AI because of excessive expectations.
