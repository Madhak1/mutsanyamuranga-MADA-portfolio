# Summary/Abstract

This project was performed in three separate parts in collaboration with
Malika Dhakhwa. Part 1 involved creating the data set. For this project,
the data set that showed demographic information of people, such as
height, weight, gender, age, and hair color. Part 2 was performed by
Malika, which involved processing and cleaning the data set. The last
part involves analyzing the data using linear models.

# Introduction

## General Background Information

The analysis was conducted for educational purposes. A theorized, messy
data set is provided, and my partner and I collaborated to process,
clean, and analyze the data set using R and Rstudio.

## Description of data and data source

The data provided was in a .xlsx file, which held the demographic
information on 14 different individual. The demographic information
included: height, weight, gender, age, and hair color.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

Was the data able to be analyzed after the process of cleaning? What can
be determined when the linear model was applied to this dataset?

# Methods

Part 1: The data set provided for the course is provided in a template
from Andreas Handel
(https://github.com/andreashandel/online-portfolio-template). The data
was manually changed to provide two new categories to the data set. The
two new categories added were: income and education level. The data set
can be found in the folder
/mutsanyamuranga-MADA-portfolio/starter-analysis-excercise/data/raw-data/exampledata2.xlsx
in the github.

Part 2: The data set was processed and cleaned by Malika Dhakhwa. The
data was loaded and read with the package ‘readx1’. The codebook was
looked at with the same package. The following used the package ‘skimr’
to assist in visualizing summary reading.

When cleaning the data, the package ‘dplyer’ was used to mutate the
incorrect data “sixty” into a numeric form in the height category. It
was also used to remove the data from the person providing “6,” as the
data provided for it had uncertainty. The person providing the weight
value “7000” was also removed. The gender category was changed from
character to categorical.

Malika then saved the data to
/mutsanyamuranga-MADA-portfolio/starter-analysis-excercise/data/processed-data/processeddata2.rds
in the github.

Part 3: A statiscal analysis is performed with the lm() function. The
statistical analysis was performed with a linear model fit between
height as the outcome and the two new variables “Age” and “Hair Color.”
The result of the linear model fit is placed on a table with the
tidyverse package. The table is then saved as “resulttable3.rds” in the
github.

## Data aquisition

The data was initially provided by Andreas Handel for the Spring 2024
MADA course. The data is then manipulated by Mutsa Nyamuranga in part 1.

## Data import and cleaning

### Setup

Load needed packages. make sure they are installed.

library(readxl) #for loading Excel files library(dplyr) #for data
processing/cleaning library(tidyr) #for data processing/cleaning
library(skimr) #for nice visualization of data library(here) #to set
paths

### Data loading

"\# path to data "\# note the use of the here() package and not absolute
paths data_location \<-
here::here("starter-analysis-exercise","data","raw-data","exampledata2.xlsx")
rawdata \<- readxl::read_excel(data_location)

### Check data

First we can look at the codebook

codebook \<- readxl::read_excel(data_location, sheet ="Codebook")
print(codebook)

### Cleaning

**Change data to numeric values**

d1 \<- rawdata %\>% dplyr::filter( Height != "sixty" ) %\>%
dplyr::mutate(Height = as.numeric(Height)) skimr::skim(d1)
hist(d1\$Height)

**Since we unfortunately don't know, we might need to remove this person
with height of 6, which we'll do here**

d2 \<- d1 %\>% dplyr::mutate( Height = replace(Height,
Height=="6",round(6\*30.48,0)) ) skimr::skim(d2)

**To be able to analyze the data, we'll remove those individuals with
weight of 7000**

d3 \<- d2 %\>% dplyr::filter(Weight != 7000) %\>% tidyr::drop_na()
skimr::skim(d3)

**Now checking the `Gender` variable.**

d3$Gender <- as.factor(d3$Gender)\
skimr::skim(d3)

**Removing that individual with that NA entry**

d4 \<- d3 %\>% dplyr::filter( !(Gender %in% c("NA","N")) ) %\>%
droplevels() skimr::skim(d4)

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

Below are the results of the data analysis of our data set.

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

@fig-result shows a boxplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height stratified by Hair Color."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","categorical-hair_color-height.png"))
```

@fig-result2 shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R
scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result2
#| fig-cap: "Weight distribution by Age."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","numerical-weight-age.png"))
```

Example @tbl-resulttable3 shows a summary of a linear model fit

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable3
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```

**Here is the code used to render this linear model analysis**

*#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.* library(ggplot2)
#for plotting library(broom) #for cleaning up output from lm()
library(here) #for data loading/saving

*#path to data*

*#note the use of the here() package and not absolute paths'*

data_location \<-
here::here("starter-analysis-exercise","data","processed-data","processeddata2.rds")

*#load data.*

mydata \<- readRDS(data_location)

*\# fit linear model using height as outcome, Hair Color and Age as
predictor*

lmfit3 \<- lm(Height \~ `Hair Color` + `Age`, mydata)

*\# place results from fit into a data frame with the tidy function\
lmtable3 \<- broom::tidy(lmfit3)*

*#look at fit results' print(lmtable3)*

*\# save fit results table*

table_file3 = here("starter-analysis-exercise","results",
"tables-files", "resulttable3.rds") saveRDS(lmtable3, file =
table_file3)

## Full analysis

It looks as though there is no apparent association between Age and
weight. In Figure 2, there appears to be no pattern in the distribution
of data points as weight increases. The individuals that showed the
greatest variation in height in accordance to Figure 1 were those with
brown hair. In the other levels, there is little variation in height.

In Table 2, the intercept provided an extremely high p=value, thus
showing that the age and hair color variables affecting the height can
not be proven or concluded.

## Conclusions

The project was a great way to improve in data analysis methods by
establishing familiarity with software such as Github, R and Rstudio to
clean analyze, and produce figures/tables for data.
